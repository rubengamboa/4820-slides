## Catalog Description

COSC 4820. **Database Systems.** 3 CR. Provides comprehensive coverage of the problems involved in database design, 
in-depth coverage of data models and database languages. Students acquire practical skills of conceptual/logical 
database design and general familiarity with the problems and issues of database management. 

**Prerequisite:** COSC 3020, Algorithms and Data Structures.

---

## Course Topics

**Textbook:** *A First Course in Database Systems* by J. Ullman and J. Widom. Prentice Hall. 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition.  2007.

* The Relational Data Model
* Relational Design Theory and Normalization
* High-Level Database Models
* Relational Algebra
* SQL
* Constraints & Triggers
* Views & Indexes
* Accessing Databases from Java Programs
* Data Warehousing

---

## Course Objectives

Students who complete this course should be able to perform the following tasks:

* Utilize database management systems that are used in industry and the computing profession.
* Express database queries in modern database languages such as SQL.
* Analyze, design, and implement database projects in accordance with industry standards (i.e. relational model, ER model, UML model, ODL model, SQL).
* Provide written, oral, and visual presentation of database projects.
* Perform basic database administration tasks.

## Evaluation Summary

There were 24 students in this course.

15 of the 24 passed the course.

The table below shows the students' performance over time. Not reflected in the table is a steady improvement of the most
important material, e.g., SQL.

## Action Items

1. Students struggle with conversion from high-level database models to SQL, 
   and they also struggle with relational design theory. But they do well with
   relational algebra and SQL.
   
   We should leverage their comfort level with OOP concepts by introducing Hibernate
   early and using it to connect the high-level E/R diagrams with lower-level OOP
   classes, as a step towards very-low-level tables.

2. Few students are engaging with the advanced/optional material at the end of the
   course, e.g., Data Warehousing.  This is partly due to the nature of the last week
   of the semester.
   
   We should remove this material from the course altogether, and use the last week
   of the semester to better prepare students for the final.
